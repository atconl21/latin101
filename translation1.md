C. Translation

Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Chaos was the first god. Children of his were Night and Earth, mother of all humans. This **(or just "she")** was the mother of Death and Destruction. Sons of these **(what number is *illius*?  who is it referring to?)** were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python were immense serpents and Cyclopes was an oafish stone mason **(*Cyclopes* is actually from *Cyclops, Cylopis*, masculine.  Can you figure out what form *fabri* and *bruti* are?)**. But their brother was Uranus, the very first king of the gods. He was brave and great, but wise.
