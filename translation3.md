Erechtheus, son of Pandion, had four children. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to lay siege to Athens, but this was defeated. Neptune, angry his son was killed by Erechteus, said "Erechtheus' daughter is sacrificed." So Cthonia, one daughter, was sacrificed. The rest of the sisters were destroyed. Erechtheus himself was struck down.
