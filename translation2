Long ago, Prometheus, first son of Iapetus, shaped man from mud. At the same time, Vulcan from mud shaped woman. Minerva gave this woman spirit and all the gods sent gifts to her. Because of it, the name "Pandora" was given to her. Pandora was given from Jove in marriage to Epimetheus. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first female mortal.
