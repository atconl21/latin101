Dictum est, quod Hercules missus ad pugnam Cerberus, Lycus putabat se mortuus est.  **(1) We want a temporal clause to express the idea "When Hercules was sent.."  (2) To express purpose, make a *gerundive* describe Cerberus.  Note that Cerberus will need to be in the accusative after *ad*.  (3) *se* is reflexive:  it refers to the same person as the subject of the sentence.  Lycus certainly didn't think that Lycus was dead!**
Lycus voluit furtum Hercules' regnum et occidere eius familia. **You've correctly used an infinitive (occidere) to construct "He wanted to kill." To construct "He wanted to steal," use an infinitive from *capio*.**
Cum Hercules audivit Lycus' consilium, ille venit et occidit eum.  **Instructions asked for a temporal clause with *subjunctive*. You've used a temporal clause with indicative.  What's the difference in meaning? (Both are possible in Latin!)**
Hercules erat punitur per Iuno, quia eius malo opere. **To express "Because of..." use the preposition *ob* with the accusative.  Review how to form the perfect tense of the passive voice, and how to express agent with passive verbs.**


Hercules' mens erat possidenda Iuno et ipse occisus est eius familia. Post hoc factum, Hercules non vis vivere et datum in servitutem.   **Let's identify the forms of these verbs and look at your choice of voice in these sentences.**
