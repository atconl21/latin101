C. Translation
Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.
Chaos was the first god. Children of his were Night and Earth, mother of all humans. This was the mother of Death and Destruction. Sons of these were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python were immense serpents and Cyclopes was an oafish stone mason. But their brother was Uranus, the very first king of the gods. He was brave and great, but wise.
