**In the clause "fidēs eī data non est", you've identified half of the verb...**
**What case is *Troiam*?**


What case is decem annōs and why? Accusative because it is a time phrase. **Expressing duration or extent of time.**
Parse possent (PNTMV) and explain its mood. Third person plural imperfect active subjunctive; subjunctive because it expresses a desire of the Greeks. **Right form. Why, specifically in this clause, does Hyginus choose subjunctive instead of indicative?**

The sentence is in the indicative mood and therefore is a factual statement. Priamus is the subject, imperavit and duci are both verbs, and equum is the object. in templum Minervae is a prepositional phrase. **You've identified the subject and main verb correctly, but "He ordered" introduces a kind of subordinated expression.**
Parse duci. Present passive infinitive

they thought their enemies left; **What tense is the infinitive of the indirect statement?**
Priamus ordered the horse to be brought to the temple of Minerva.
When the prophet Cassandra said there were enemies in the horse,  **What is the subject and verb of the indirect statement?**
