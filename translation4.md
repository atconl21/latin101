When the Greeks could not capture Troy for ten years, Epeus made a large wooden horse. In it collected Ulysses, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas Thoas, Machaon, and Neoplolemus. And written on the horse was "Greeks' gift to Minerva," the camp transferred to Tenedos. When the Trojans saw, they thought their enemies left; Priamus ordered the horse to be brought to the temple of Minerva. When the prophet Cassandra said there were enemies in the horse, no faith was given to her and the horse was placed in the temple. The Greeks exited the gates and the guards were killed and Troy was seized.
